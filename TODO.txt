--> ADD TAG SUPPORT! THIS MEANS SUBCLASSES OF TAGREFERENCE, SERIALIZATION, AND CUSTOM INTERFACES FOR EACH TYPE OF TAG


5 layers of storing blocks in configs
1. Set of String <--- Base
2. Set of Identifier <--- Less parsing required, using Registry to convert blocks to Identifiers = O(1) search type
3. Set of Block <--- No caching required if you wanted to convert to set of blocks, very easy to use
4. Set of BlockReference <--- Adds back support to modded blocks by default (step 3 doesn't have) AND support to data driven types
5. Set of ConfigBlock <--- Adds support to block tags, i.e. #minecraft:carpets for all carpets
